  <h1> What is Artificial Intelligence ?</h1>

   <p>
    Artificial intelligence (AI) it is referred to as the simulation of human intelligence in programmed machines to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that shows traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.
    <br><br>
   it is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks which are commonly associated with intelligent beings.
    <br><br>
   The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks like for example, finding proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess with great proficiency. <br>Still, despite continuous development in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. <br>On the other hand, several programs have reached the human experts and professionals performance levels in performing specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition. 
   <br><br>
   AI research is defined as the study of "intelligent agents " in Computer science: any device that perceives environment around it and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. A more systematic definition characterizes AI as "a system's ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation."
   <br>
   Artificial intelligence can be divided into two main types: weak and strong. 
   <br><br>
   Weak artificial intelligence embodies a system designed to perform one particular job. Weak AI systems include video games such as the chess example from above and personal assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. You ask the assistant a question, it answers it for you.

   Strong artificial intelligence systems are systems that carry on the tasks considered to be human-like. These processes tend to be more complex and complicated. They are programmed to handle situations in which they may be required to problem solve without a human presence. These types of systems can be found in applications like self-driving cars or in hospital operating rooms.
