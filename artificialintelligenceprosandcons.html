<h3> List of the Pros of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<h4>  1. Artificial intelligence can work indefinitely.</h4>

Human workers are generally good for 8-10 hours of production every day. Artificial intelligence may continue operating for an indefinite time. As long as there is a power resource available to it, and the equipment is properly cared for, AI machines do not experience the same losses in productivity that human workers experience when they get stressed when the day ends.

<h4> 2. Artificial intelligence makes fewer errors. </h4>
AI is important in certain fields and industries where accuracy or precision is the top priority. When there are no room for error, these machines are capable of breaking down complicated math constructs into practical actions faster, and with more accuracy, when compared to human workers.

<h4> 3. Artificial intelligence helps us to explore. </h4>
There are many places in our universe where it would be unsafe, if not impossible, for humans to see. AI makes it possible for us to know more about these places, which furthers our species knowledge database. We can explore the deepest parts of the ocean because of AI. We can journey to inhospitable planets because of AI. We can even find new resources to consume because of this technology.

<h4> 4. Artificial intelligence makes us become more productive. </h4>
To be productive, people need to have a rest from time to time. A great reinforcement of this human weakness can be reached with AI-powered machines. 
They will not get tired, bored, or distracted. Artificial intelligence-based machines will not need a break. Once programmed for long hours, they will work 24x7.
Besides, they can take over extra hard work and with much higher capacity.

<h4> 5. Artificial intelligence extends the human experience. </h4>
With an AI helping each of us, we have the power to do more, be more, and explore more than ever before. In other ways, this evolutionary process could be our destiny. Some believe that computers and humanity are not separate, but instead a single, cognitive unit that already works together for the betterment of all. Through AI, people who are blind can now see. Those who are deaf can now hear. We become better because we have a greater capacity to do things.
 
<h3> List of the Cons of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<h4> 1. Artificial intelligence comes with a high price tag. </h4>
A new artificial intelligence is costly to build. Although the price is coming down, individual developments can still be as high as $300,000 for a basic AI. 
<h4> 2. Artificial intelligence will reduce employment opportunities. </h4>
There will be jobs gained because of AI. There will also be jobs lost because of it. Any job which features repetitive tasks as part of its duties is at-risk of being replaced by an artificial intelligence in the future.
<h4> 3. Artificial intelligence will be tasked with its own decisions. </h4>
One of the greatest threats we face with AI is its decision-making mechanism. An AI is only as intelligent and insightful as the individuals responsible for its initial programming. That means there could be a certain bias found within is mechanisms when it is time to make an important decision.
<h4> 4. Artificial intelligence can be inaccurate. </h4>
Machine translations have become an important tool in our quest to communicate with one another universally. The only problem with these translations is that they must be reviewed by humans because the words, not the intent of the words, is what machines translate. Without a review by a trained human translator, the information received from a machine translation may be inaccurate or insensitive, that will create more problems instead of fewer with our overall communication.
<br><br>
These artificial intelligence pros and cons show us that our world can take advantage from its presence in a number of ways. There are also many potential dangers which come with this technology. Jobs may be created, but jobs will be lost. Lives could be saved, but lives could also be lost. That is why the technologies behind AI must be made available to everyone. If only a few hold the power of AI, then the world could become a very different place in a short period of time.
